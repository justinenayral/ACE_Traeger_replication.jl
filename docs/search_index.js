These models are designed to evaluate the long-term interactions among economic production, greenhouse gas emissions, and global warming. C. Traeger discusses the implications of temperature and carbon tax impact. The persistence of carbon increases the optimal tax twofold to thirtyfold, depending on the calibration. On the contrary, the delay in temperature dynamics (Ocean cooling) decreases the carbon tax from 65 to 25%. The Analytic Climate Economy (ACE) model is close to Nordhaus' DICE model. It incorporates most elements of IAMs. Labor, capital, technology and energy produced output are either consumed or invested. The author distinguish \"Dirty\" energy sectors, consuming fossil fuels and generating greenhouse gas emissions. These gases accumulate in the atmorsphere causing radiative forcing and increase global temperature, which reduces output. This economic model aims at helping economists to develop more accurate opinions about the social cost of carbon.","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html#Data-availability","page":"Home","title":"Data availability","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"index.html","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Our replication packages require downloading the data used by the authors from the orginal replication package.","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html#Path","page":"Home","title":"Path","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"index.html","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"The user needs to save the data and the julia package in path:","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"path = \"C:/Users/...\"","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Figures generated are saved in path:","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html#Packages","page":"Home","title":"Packages","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"index.html","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Before using the package, it is required to install:","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"using Pkg \nPkg.add(\"MAT\") #To open .mat datasets\nPkg.add(\"Printf\") #For labelling graphs\nPkg.add(\"LinearAlgebra\")\nPkg.add(\"DataFrames\")\nPkg.add(\"CSV\")\nPkg.add(\"XLSX\")\nPkg.add(\"NLsolve\")\nPkg.add((\"Plots\")","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html#Dammage-functions","page":"Home","title":"Dammage functions","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"index.html","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"The authors used differents definition for calculating environment damages.
